# Logistic-regression-on-Mnist-dataset
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology")
The training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image. The test data set, (test.csv), is the same as the training set, except that it does not contain the "label" column.
In my code, I have done Logistic Regression because it is a discrete dataset.
